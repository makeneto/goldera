# Goldera - Collaborative Decision System for Gold Purchase and Resale

Goldera is a collaborative project developed to structure and professionalize the purchase and resale of physical gold through an intelligent calculator oriented to financial decision. The platform allows you to enter weight, carat and price per gram to convert real purity, calculate intrinsic value, margin, ROI and reinvestment capacity. In addition, the system automatically integrates the strategic deduction of 30% for the intermediary responsible for originating the transaction, ensuring a clear, standardized and sustainable distribution of profits.
